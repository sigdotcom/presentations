# SIG.com Presentations

All of the slides for SIG.com are written using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)

To begin a presentation, copy the template.html file into a directory within either meetings or workshops.
From there, edit it as you see fit.
__Any auxiliary files should be put into subfolders of the presentation folder (ie. img, css)__


Naming for workshops starts with an integer, which will be one higher than the last. It then follows with a word or phrase to describe the topic.

Naming for meetings follows the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard, YYYY-MM-DD.
