### Experience
Since I began programming in High School, I have done a number of projects, most notably [acm.mst.edu](https://acm.mst.edu)

- HTML/CSS
- Python

- Vagrant

Through SIG.com I have also been hosting meetings, workshops and helping with team management.

[Swoly](https://github.com/triPi-Devs/SwolyV2) is developed using:
